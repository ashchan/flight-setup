# Flight Setup

Personal HOTAS &amp; other setups for Flight Simulator âœˆ

## Controllers

* Throttle: [VPC MongoosT-50CM3](Controllers/VPC_MongoosT-50CM3/README.md)
* Grip: [VKB Gunfighter Mk.III 'Modern Combat Edition' Ultimate](Controllers/VKB_MCG_Ultimate/README.md)
* Head tracking: [TrackIR](Controllers/TrackIR/README.md)
* Rudder: Currently I don't use a rudder. Instead the built-in twist on the MCG Ultimate grip is used as rudder for Yaw.
