# VKB T-Rudders Mk.IV

Used with default settings, connecting to its own black box.

MCG Ultimate has twist adapters. Although the grid can be configured to work together with the T-Rudders, I'd rather use two black boxes and keep them separate.

## Assign axis edges to buttons

T-Rudders have only one axis, which is `#7`(`RotX`). This sets it up to have two buttons (one for either end), in case I need virtual toe brakes in the future.

1. Go to Profile/Axes/Axes2Buttons.
1. For `7`, set Type to `Edges2`, Num to `1`, Hysteresis to `5%`.
1. Double click VBut1 (`2`), from the popup Virtual layer window select a free (green) button. That button and the one followed will be used.
1. Click `Action/Set` to save to device.
